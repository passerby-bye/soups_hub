Turtle Soup is a creative and engaging game based on the concept of "Turtle Soup", a popular game where players guess a story behind a seemingly absurd or mysterious scenario. In this version, powered by a large language model (LLM), the game leverages advanced natural language processing to generate intriguing, unpredictable, and interactive stories.

Scenario Generation: The game starts with the LLM providing a mysterious or puzzling scenario. This scenario is crafted to be open-ended and engaging, often leading to unexpected and imaginative situations.

Guessing and Interaction: Players ask yes-or-no questions to unravel the story behind the scenario. The LLM responds to these questions based on the context of the scenario, guiding players toward understanding the complete narrative.

Unveiling the Story: As players ask questions and receive answers, they piece together the story, eventually reaching the point where they can understand the full context or reveal the hidden twist.
